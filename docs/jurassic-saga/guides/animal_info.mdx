# Creature Needs

Unlike vanilla Minecraft, creatures in **Jurassic Saga** have survival requirements.  
Managing these needs is essential to keeping your dinosaurs alive and healthy.

---

## Thirst
Like real life, dinosaurs require water.  
### How it works
- Each creature has a thirst meter that decreases over time.  
- If thirst is not met, the creature’s health and behavior may be affected.  

### How to fulfill
- Provide access to **water sources** (ponds, rivers).  
- Some creatures may drink directly from natural water blocks.

## Hunger
Dinosaurs also need food, with diets depending on species.  
### How it works
- Hunger decreases steadily and must be replenished.  
- Diet types currently include:  
  - **Carnivore** — eats meat (raw beef, fish, etc.)  
  - **Herbivore** — eats plants (leaves)  
  - **Insectivore** — eats insects or small arthropods  

### How to fulfill
- Place food items in feeders.  
- Match the food type to the creature’s diet, incorrect food will be ignored.

## Sleep *(occasional)*
Some creatures will rest or sleep periodically.  
- Sleep may affect activity cycles (day/night behavior).  

---

## Other Needs *(future mechanics)*
Based on development progress, additional needs may be added, such as:  
- **Temperature** — cold/warm environments affecting survival  
- **Social behavior** — herd or pack requirements  
- **Shelter** — protection from weather or predators

## Tips
- Always check the creature’s diet before feeding.  
- Build enclosures with both food and water sources.  
- Monitor creatures regularly, neglecting thirst or hunger can lead to death.
