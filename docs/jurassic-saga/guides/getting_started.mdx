# Getting Started

Welcome to **Jurassic Saga**! This guide will walk you through your first steps in the mod, starting with collecting [Remains](@jurassic-saga:remains) 
and processing them into DNA. From there, you’ll learn how to create prehistoric creatures or modify their genetic code.

## [Remains](@jurassic-saga:remains)

### Obtaining
Remains are the foundation of your journey. They are obtained exclusively through **mining**.  
Different types of remains can be found depending on the Y-level and biome:
- **Marine remains**  
- **Flora remains**  
- **Aquatic remains**  
- **Specific creature remains**

Exploring different depths increases your chance of finding varied fossil types.

---

### Usage
Remains are processed in the [Genetic Analyzer](@jurassic-saga:genetic_analyzer).  
When analyzed, they yield:

- **DNA fragments** of the specific creature or type the remains belong to.  
- DNA quality ranges from **1% to 100%**, depending on the sample.

Fragments can be combined into full DNA strands, which unlock the next stage of your adventure.

### Next Steps
Once you have DNA, you can choose between two paths:

- [Creating an Egg](../guides/creating_an_egg)  
  Requires a normal creature egg, which is then fertilized with DNA.  
  Available unfertilized eggs include:  
  - **Frog** — Good for Amphibians  
  - **Ostrich** — Large Reptiles or Birds  
  - **Fish** — Aquatic Creatures  
  - **Basilisk** — Small Reptiles  
  - **Spider** — Insectoid  
  - **Alligator** — Medium Reptiles and Birds  

- [Modifying DNA](../guides/modifying_dna)  
  Use the DNA Modifier to add genes and customize traits. Current gene options include:  
  - Fertility improvements  
  - Gender determination (male/female chance)  
  - Toughness  
  - Aggressiveness  
  - Color/skin variations

## Progression Flow
Here's a quick tutorial to start your journey of De-Extinction:

1. Mine [Fossils](@jurassic-saga:remains)  
2. Analyze your findings with the [Genetic Analyzer](@jurassic-saga:genetic_analyzer)  
3. Obtain and combine the resulting DNA fragments to obtain a full 100% DNA Token  
4. [Customize your DNA]($guides/modifying_dna) to your taste using various genes or cosmetics
5. Inject your DNA within a corresponding [hatched egg]($guides/creating_an_egg) with a syringe
6. Once you everything is set, you are ready to start your very own... Jurassic Saga

## Tips for Beginners
- Bring plenty of mining tools, remains are scattered across different Y-levels.  
- Track which fossil types appear at which depths to target specific creatures.  
- Store DNA fragments carefully; high-percentage samples are especially valuable.  
- Decide early whether you want to focus on **breeding creatures** or **genetic experimentation**.  
- Check related documentation for deeper mechanics: [Genetic Analyzer](@jurassic-saga:genetic_analyzer), [Creating an Egg]($guides/creating_an_egg), and [Modifying DNA]($guides/modifying_dna).
