# DNA Modification

DNA modification is an optional but highly useful step in **Jurassic Saga**.  
It allows you to refine DNA quality to 100% and add genetic traits, ensuring stronger and more predictable creatures.

## Increasing DNA Quality

When you first obtain DNA pieces, you’ll notice a **DNA Quality: X%** value.  
This percentage can be increased by combining two DNAs of the same creature in the [DNA Modifier](@jurassic-saga:dna_modifier).

- The process is simple addition:  
  - Example: 56% DNA + 44% DNA = 100% DNA  
  - Example: 20% DNA + 33% DNA = 53% DNA  

Continue combining until you reach a full **100% DNA strand**.

## Adding Genes

The DNA Modifier also allows you to insert genes that affect specific traits. Current options include:

- Fertility improvements  
- Gender chance (male/female)  
- Toughness  
- Aggressiveness  
- Color/skin variations  

These modifications let you customize your creatures and create unique results.

## Why Modify DNA?

- **Higher success rates** when creating fertilized eggs  
- **Stronger offspring** with improved survival chances  
- **Customization** for park aesthetics and gameplay variety

## Next Steps

Once you have a 100% DNA strand (and optionally enhanced it with genes), proceed to [Creating an Egg]($guides/creating_an_egg) to fertilize and prepare it for incubation.
