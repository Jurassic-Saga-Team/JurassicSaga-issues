# Cultivating Eggs

If you are reading this, you’ve completed all the previous steps and now have a **Fertilized Egg** in your inventory. The final stage is cultivation, turning that fertilized egg into a living creature.

## Process

1. **Place the Egg in the Incubator**  
   - Open the [Incubator](@jurassic-saga:incubator).  
   - Insert the fertilized egg into any of the 5 available slots.  
   - Cultivation begins automatically.  

2. **Wait for Cultivation**  
   - After a short period (around 5 minutes, depending on settings), the incubator will output a **Hatched Egg**.  

3. **Retrieve the Hatched Egg**  
   - Carefully remove the hatched egg from the incubator.  
   - Handle with care, dropping it will destroy the egg. (Not really)

4. **Place the Egg in the World**  
   - Right‑click on the ground to place the hatched egg.  
   - The egg will begin the hatching process.  

5. **Support the Creature**  
   - Ensure you have the basics ready (food, shelter, environment).  
   - Without proper care, the newborn creature may not survive.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You’ve successfully cultivated your first prehistoric egg.  
From here, you can begin raising your creature, experimenting with genetics, or expanding your park.

## Tips

- Keep multiple incubators running to speed up your park’s growth.  
- Always prepare food and habitat before hatchingm newborns are fragile.  
- Track incubation times; different species may vary slightly.  
- Avoid carrying hatched eggs recklessly, they are delicate until placed.
