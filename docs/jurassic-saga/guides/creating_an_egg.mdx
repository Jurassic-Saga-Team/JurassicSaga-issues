<h2>DNA</h2>
This item can have a value of 1% to 100%. However even a 53% or 20% or even 1% can turn to 100%, by combining 2 DNAs in the DNA Modifier, it's basic addition 1+1=2%. 
<h3>Usage</h3>
Once you obtained a DNA of a certain creature you'll require an Egg, depending on creature will require a specific egg, and a Syringe (Clean). 
You'll then need to clean the egg if it's fertile, to do this, simply place the egg in the crafting table, alongside a clean syringe, and it will output a "Unfertilized x Egg".
After having both the DNA and the Unfertile Egg, place both of them in the crafting table, with a clean syring alongside too, this will output a "Fertilized x Egg".
After this you'll need a Incubator, to start cultivating the egg
