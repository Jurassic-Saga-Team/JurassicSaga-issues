# Getting Started

Welcome to **Jurassic Saga**! This guide will walk you through your first steps in the mod, starting with collecting [Remains](@jurassic-saga:remains) 
and processing them into DNA. From there, you’ll learn how to create prehistoric creatures or modify their genetic code.

---

## [Remains](@jurassic-saga:remains)

### Obtaining
Remains are the foundation of your journey. They can be obtained in several ways:
- Mining

---

### Usage
Remains are processed in the [Genetic Analyzer](@jurassic-saga:genetic_analyzer).  
When analyzed, they may yield:

- DNA fragments — the key to creating or modifying species   

DNA fragments can be combined into full DNA strands, which unlock the next stage of your adventure.

### Next Steps
Once you have DNA, you can choose between two paths:

- [Creating an Egg](@jurassic-saga:creating_an_egg)  
  Requires having an normal creature egg, and then "fertilizing it with the DNA

- [Modifying DNA](@jurassic-saga:modifying_dna)  
  Use the DNA Modifier to alter genes, and create the "perfect" creature

## Progression Flow
Here’s a quick overview of your early progression:

1. Collect [Remains](@jurassic-saga:remains)  
2. Analyze remains in the [Genetic Analyzer](@jurassic-saga:genetic_analyzer)  
3. Obtain DNA fragments and combine them into full strands  
4. Choose your path: [Creating an Egg](@jurassic-saga:creating_an_egg) or [Modifying DNA](@jurassic-saga:modifying_dna)  
5. Continue your journey: hatch creatures, experiment with genetics, expand your park!

## Tips for Beginners
- Always carry extra tools when fossil hunting — remains are often buried deep.  
- Store DNA fragments safely; they’re valuable and sometimes rare.  
- Decide early whether you want to focus on **breeding creatures** or **genetic experimentation** — both paths are rewarding but require different resources.  
- Check related documentation for deeper mechanics: [$Genetic Analyzer]($jurassic-saga:genetic_analyzer), [$Creating an Egg]($jurassic-saga:creating_an_egg), and [$Modifying DNA]($jurassic-saga:modifying_dna).
