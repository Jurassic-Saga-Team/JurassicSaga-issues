# Creating an Egg

With DNA obtained during [Getting Started]($guides/getting_started) and refined in [DNA Modification]($guides/modifying_dna), you’re ready to create a fertilized egg. This is the crucial step toward bringing prehistoric creatures back to life.

## Requirements
To create a fertilized egg, you’ll need:
- A **DNA strand** (ideally 100% quality)  
- A **normal creature egg** (type depends on the species)  
- A **Syringe (Clean)**  

### Egg Types
Each DNA requires a specific egg base:
- **Frog Egg** — Amphibians  
- **Ostrich Egg** — Large Reptiles or Birds  
- **Fish Egg** — Aquatic Creatures  
- **Basilisk Egg** — Small Reptiles  
- **Spider Egg** — Insectoid Creatures  
- **Alligator Egg** — Medium Reptiles and Birds

## Process

1. **Clean the Egg**  
   - Place the egg in a crafting table with a clean syringe.  
   - Output: **Unfertilized X Egg** (where *X* is the egg type).  

2. **Fertilize the Egg**  
   - Place the DNA, the unfertilized egg, and a clean syringe together in the crafting table.  
   - Output: **Fertilized X Egg**.  

3. **Prepare for Cultivation**  
   - The fertilized egg is now ready to be placed in an [Incubator](@jurassic-saga:incubator).

## Next Steps
You’ve successfully created a fertilized egg! The next stage is [Cultivating Eggs]($guides/cultivating_eggs), where you’ll learn how to nurture and hatch your prehistoric creatures.

## Tips
- Always use a clean syringe — dirty ones won’t work.  
- Match DNA to the correct egg type; mismatches won’t fertilize.  
- Higher DNA percentages increase success rates, so consider refining DNA first in the [DNA Modifier]($guides/modifying_dna).
