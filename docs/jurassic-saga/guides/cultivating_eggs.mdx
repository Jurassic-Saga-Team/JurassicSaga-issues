<h2>Process</h2>
If you are reading this, you've done all the steps until now, and should have a Fertilized Egg in your inventory.
If so simply place it inside the incubator on any of the 5 slots, and it will start cultivating.
After a couple of seconds, maybe 5mins? You should see a "Hatched Egg" inside the incubator.
Simply take it out now, carefully now, don't drop it or you'll have Prehistoric Omelettes (don't try).
Now just place it down, by right clicking somewhere, and it should start the hatching process, make sure you have the basics or it will die.
